# Gene expression of Glutamate Receptor associated genes

## 2024-07-01

From HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee ([HGNC](genenames.org) last updated on 2024-06-28), I downloaded the table of genes for the following genes groups:

| Gene Group        | Name                                                  | file                                |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| SLC1              | Solute carrier family 1                               | `HGNCgroup-2154_SLC1.csv`           |
| GRIN              | Glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunits      | `HGNCgroup-1201_GRIN.csv`           |
| GRIA              | Glutamate ionotropic receptor AMPA type subunits      | `HGNCgroup-1200_GRIA.csv`           |
| GRM               | Glutamate metabotropic receptors                      | `HGNCgroup-281_GRM.csv`             |
| GRK               | AGC family kinases: G protein-coupled receptor kinase | `HGNCgroup-1625_AGCkinases_GRK.csv` |
| PPPR1 [^readme-1] | Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunits             | `HGNCgroup-694_PPPR1.csv`           |

These gene groups were summarized in `glutamate-genes.csv` Genes found in GBM-GE scRNA-seq assay are listed here: `glutamate-genes_present-in-GBM-GE.csv`
